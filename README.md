#Mars Rover- take home challenge
This repository contains my solution to the Mars Rover problem using Scala.
I have attempted the problem using Scala and adopting functional programming. I adopted Test Driven Development using ScalaTest package and used immutable data structures and pure functions to model the behaviour of the rover and parse the inputs. 
In my opinion, this makes reasoning about code easier and simplifies testing.


I assueme that the user has sbt on machine.
Please sbt run. 
The inputs to be provided in the input txt file and the. As example, inputs from the are provided in 

Testing

To run test, please run following: sbt test in the root folder.
Unit testing with TDD approach to test the correctess of hte functions.
Tested against the cases provided in the specification.
If I had more time, I would more test for user inouts.



Implementation
